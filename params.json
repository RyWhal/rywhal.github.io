Coffee-script is an easily readable language that compiles its code into JavaScript... I want to use it to write some hubot scripts, but we'll see what happens\r\n\r\nIt starts with one command    o.O\r\n```\r\n$ npm install coffee-script\r\nnpm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/coffee-script\r\nnpm http 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/coffee-script\r\nnpm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/coffee-script/-/coffee-script-1.7.1.tgz\r\nnpm http 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/coffee-script/-/coffee-script-1.7.1.tgz\r\nnpm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/mkdirp\r\nnpm http 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/mkdirp\r\nnpm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/mkdirp/-/mkdirp-0.3.5.tgz\r\nnpm http 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/mkdirp/-/mkdirp-0.3.5.tgz\r\ncoffee-script@1.7.1 node_modules/coffee-script\r\n└── mkdirp@0.3.5\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
